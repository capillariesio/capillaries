A simple tool to creade run transcripts and export them to html for documentation and blog.

Reads and prints the script, reads data from Cassandra tables and prints first few rows.

Before running transcript scripts, run local tests against the docker demo so the data for transcripts appear in Cassandra tables, but do not run "clean" for them until transcripts are generated.
